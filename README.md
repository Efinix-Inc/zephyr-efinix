This is a guide for setting up the development environment for the Efinix FPGA to develop Zephyr project
==================================================

Introduction
-------------
Welcome to the Zephyr project on Efinix FPGA development environment! This project serves as a starting point for building and debugging Zephyr projects using Docker containers, which provide a self-contained environment to facilitate installation and development. The VS Code IDE is utilized for developing the Zephyr project, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience. Furthermore, the Sapphire SoC is utilized as a configurable RISC-V core generated by Efinix efinity tool. With this project, you can jumpstart your Zephyr project development and enjoy a streamlined workflow.

Prerequisites
--------------

Please ensure that you have the following hardware and software requirements:

#### Hardware:
- Titanium Ti60F225 Development Kit (https://www.efinixinc.com/products-devkits-titaniumti60f225.html)

#### Software:

Before proceeding with the setup, ensure that the following software are installed on your computer:

For all platforms:
- Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Docker Desktop (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

For Windows:

- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS environment (https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/ubuntu-22042-lts/9PN20MSR04DW)
- usbipd-win 2.4.1 (https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases/download/v2.4.1/usbipd-win_2.4.1.msi)
- Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Setup
------

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    - Launch VS Code and Clone the repository to your local machine:
    - Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P`
    - Type `"Git: Clone"` and hit enter
    - Enter the current URL of the repository and hit enter
    - Choose the directory where you want to clone the repository and hit enter
    - When prompted, click on the "Open" button

2. Install recommended VS Code extensions

    - Open the Command Palette, Type `"Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions"` and hit enter
    - Install all the recommended extensions shown in the list on top left corner of the screen

3. Build the Docker image:

    - Open the Command Palette and type `docker build image`

    - Tag the image as `efinix/zephyr:latest` and wait for the build process to complete.

4. Start and Connect to the container:

    - Click on the "Remote Explorer" extension icon on the left sidebar.
    - Click on "Open Folder In Container"
    - Select the current folder/directory (cloned repo)
    - Wait for the container to start and load the workspace
    - You may be asked to `Reload Window` to complete the setup. Click on `Reload Window` to complete the setup

5. Initial setup of the development environment:

    - Open the terminal in VS Code, In the command palette, type `Terminal: Create New Terminal (In Active Workspace)` and hit enter
    - Execute the following commands:
        - `cd /zephyr`
        - `./zephyr_efx_setup.sh` --> This script will pull the Zephyr project repo with Efinix board support

- **The development environment Zephyr project with Efinix support is ready. You can now start developing and testing your project**

USBIP Setup for Windows:
------------------------
1. Launch terminal as run as administrator
2. Run `usbipd list` --> This command will list all the USB devices connected to the host machine, note down the BUS ID of the development board, it should be something like `Titanium Ti60F225 Development Kit`
3. Run `usbipd wsl attach -b <BUS ID> --distribution Ubuntu-22.04` --> replace <BUS ID> with the actual BUS ID of the development board


Development Process
--------------------
1. Obtain the Efinix Sapphire RISC-V SoC bitstream, either by using the pre-configured one or by generating a configurable one yourself

- *Pre-configured bitstream:* You will find archiev in `volume/soc_efinity/sapphire_soc.zip`, unzip the file
and the compiled bitstream of the SoC is found in `sapphire_soc\ip\sapphire_soc\Ti60F225_devkit\outflow` as `soc.hex`

**OR**

- *Generate a customized SoC yourself:*

2. Obtain the zephyr firmware, run the command `west build -b titanium_ti60_f225 /samples/hello_world -p always` in the `/zephyr/zephyr` directory to build a sample "hello world" project

3. Combine both the bitstream and firmware, and flash the resulting image, refer the guide here to flash the image to the development board: https://www.efinixinc.com/support/docsdl.php?s=ef&pn=SAPPHIREUG refer to the section `Copy a User Binary to Flash (Efinity Programmer)`, pg 63
4. Verify that everything went smoothly by checking the serial console, where you should see the message "Hello World!" It should look like in the image shown below

Note: The efinity project to generate bitstream is found in `volume/soc_efinity/sapphire_soc.zip`
